5. View discovered hosts

### Configuration Options

Each tool provides configurable settings:

**Port Scanner:**
- Port range (e.g., "1-1000", "80,443,8080")
- Thread count (1-100)
- Connection timeout (seconds)

**Directory Buster:**
- Wordlist file path
- File extensions to test
- Thread count
- Request timeout

**Virtual Host Scanner:**
- Wordlist file path
- Thread count
- Request timeout

**Host Scanner:**
- Scan method (ping+tcp)
- Thread count
- Ping timeout

### Results Management

**Viewing Results:**
1. Results appear directly within each tool's interface as scans complete
2. Each tool shows its specific results in real-time below the menu options
3. Results are color-coded by type and status (green for success, red for errors, yellow for warnings)
4. Navigate to "View Results" from main menu for consolidated view of all results

**Available Options in Each Tool:**
- **Start Scan** - Begin scanning with current settings
- **Configure Settings** - Modify tool-specific parameters
- **Clear Results** - Remove results for this specific tool only
- **Back to Main Menu** - Return to main interface

**Global Results Management:**
- **View Results** - See all results from all tools in one consolidated view
- **Export Results** - Save all results to timestamped file in results/ directory
- **Filter Results** - Search through all results by keyword

**Export Formats:**
- Results are exported to `results/scan_results_YYYYMMDD_HHMMSS.txt`
- Configuration saved to `network_tools_config.txt`

```

## Testing

Run the test suite to verify all functionality:
```bash
python test_network_tools.py
```

The test suite validates:
- Port scanning capabilities
- Directory enumeration
- Virtual host discovery
- Host discovery methods
- Configuration system

## Wordlists

The application includes comprehensive wordlists:

**Directory Wordlist** (`wordlists/common_dirs.txt`):
- 133+ common web directories and files
- Includes admin panels, backup locations, configuration files
- Standard web application paths

**Virtual Host Wordlist** (`wordlists/common_vhosts.txt`):
- 98+ common subdomain patterns
- Development, staging, and production environments
- Service-specific subdomains (mail, ftp, api, etc.)

## Security Considerations

**Ethical Usage:**
- Only scan networks and systems you own or have explicit permission to test
- Respect rate limits and avoid overwhelming target systems
- Be aware of legal implications in your jurisdiction

**Performance:**
- Default thread counts are conservative for stability
- Increase threads cautiously to avoid network congestion
- Monitor system resources during intensive scans

**Network Impact:**
- Tools generate network traffic that may be logged
- Directory and virtual host scanning can generate many HTTP requests
- Consider using VPN or proxy for sensitive testing

## Troubleshooting

**Common Issues:**

1. **Curses Display Problems:**
   - Ensure terminal supports curses
   - Try resizing terminal window
   - Use modern terminal emulator

2. **Permission Errors:**
   - Some features may require elevated privileges
   - Ping functionality might need sudo on some systems

3. **Network Connectivity:**
   - Verify internet connection for web-based tools
   - Check firewall settings if scans fail
   - Ensure target hosts are reachable

4. **Performance Issues:**
   - Reduce thread count in configuration
   - Increase timeout values for slow networks
   - Use smaller wordlists for faster scans

## Contributing

This is a complete, production-ready networking utility. For modifications:

1. Review the modular architecture in `network_tools.py`
2. UI modifications should be made in `ui_manager.py`
3. Configuration changes go in `config.py`
4. Add tests to `test_network_tools.py` for new features
